## Audio Characteristics from Spotify

Spotify provides a range of audio characteristics that can add depth to song analysis. Below is a detailed explanation of each feature, including how to interpret it in the context of music.

### 1. Popularity
- **Description**: Popularity is a score that reflects how frequently a track has been played, saved, or added to playlists by users on Spotify, with recent activity weighing more heavily than older interactions.
- **Range**: 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating greater popularity.
- **Calculation**: Spotify doesn’t reveal the exact formula, but it considers factors like play count, user engagement, and recency of listens.
- **Interpretation**: 
  - A high popularity score (e.g., above 70) typically suggests that a track is widely listened to and often included in playlists or saved by users, reflecting its appeal.
  - A low score (e.g., below 20) might indicate that the track is relatively obscure, new, or less engaging for listeners on the platform.


### 2. Danceability
   - **Description**: Danceability measures how suitable a track is for dancing based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, where higher values are more danceable.
   - **Interpretation**: Tracks with high danceability are more likely to be rhythmic and steady, fitting genres like pop, electronic, or hip-hop.

### 3. Energy
   - **Description**: Energy represents a song’s intensity and activity level, considering loudness, tempo, and timbre.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values indicating more energetic tracks.
   - **Interpretation**: Songs with high energy are often loud, fast, and rhythm-heavy, common in rock, metal, or uptempo pop.

### 4. Valence
   - **Description**: Valence indicates the musical positiveness of a track. Tracks with high valence sound more cheerful and positive, while lower values sound more melancholic.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0.
   - **Interpretation**: A track with high valence (e.g., 0.8) might evoke happiness or excitement, whereas low valence (e.g., 0.2) could reflect sadness or tension.

### 5. Acousticness
   - **Description**: Acousticness measures the likelihood that a track is acoustic, based on its sound profile.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values suggesting a more acoustic sound.
   - **Interpretation**: High acousticness indicates minimal electronic influence, which is common in genres like folk or acoustic pop.

### 6. Instrumentalness
   - **Description**: Instrumentalness estimates the probability of a track being instrumental, without vocal content.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, with values closer to 1.0 suggesting fewer vocals.
   - **Interpretation**: High instrumentalness values may align with instrumental genres, like classical, jazz, or electronic instrumentals.

### 7. Liveness
   - **Description**: Liveness detects if a song was recorded live, based on factors like crowd noise and reverberation.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, with values above 0.8 indicating a high likelihood of live recording.
   - **Interpretation**: Songs with high liveness are likely live performances, which could influence the song's energy and audience connection.

### 8. Speechiness
   - **Description**: Speechiness measures the presence of spoken words in a track.
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, where values above 0.66 indicate a high concentration of spoken words, like in podcasts.
   - **Interpretation**: High speechiness could indicate spoken-word content or genres like hip-hop or rap, which blend music with spoken elements.

### 9. Tempo
   - **Description**: Tempo represents the beats per minute (BPM) of a track, which affects the song’s pace.
   - **Range**: BPM values typically range from 50 to 200.
   - **Interpretation**: Higher tempos (120+ BPM) are common in dance and electronic music, while slower tempos (below 100 BPM) are often found in ballads and chill genres.

### 10. Mode
   - **Description**: Mode indicates the modality of a track—either major or minor scale. Major often sounds brighter, while minor sounds darker or sadder.
   - **Range**: 0 (minor) or 1 (major).
   - **Interpretation**: A major mode may align with happier-sounding music, whereas a minor mode often reflects sadness or tension, common in genres like classical or blues.

### 11. Loudness
   - **Description**: Loudness measures the average decibel level of a track, providing a sense of its overall volume.
   - **Range**: Typically between -60 and 0 dB, with higher (closer to 0) values indicating louder songs.
   - **Interpretation**: Loud tracks can feel more powerful or intense, often found in rock or EDM, whereas quieter tracks may suggest a relaxed or introspective mood.

### 12. Time Signature
   - **Description**: The time signature represents the number of beats in each measure, helping define a song’s rhythm structure.
   - **Range**: Common values are 3 (waltz-like feel), 4 (standard pop or rock feel), or more complex signatures like 5 or 7 in jazz and progressive music.
   - **Interpretation**: Standard time signatures (like 4) are easy to follow and common in mainstream music, while unusual signatures may create a unique or experimental feel.
